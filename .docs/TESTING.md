# Testing Strategies 🧪

Writing tests is essential for ensuring code quality, preventing regressions, and enabling confident refactoring. This guide describes the recommended testing strategies and tools for this boilerplate. 📋

## Testing Pyramid 🔺

The testing pyramid represents the three levels of testing, from most numerous to least:

1. **Unit Tests (Base)** ⚛️

    - Fast, numerous tests that verify specific logic
    - Focus on individual functions, utilities, and small components
    - Should be the majority of your tests

2. **Integration Tests (Middle)** 🔄

    - Test the interaction between multiple units or components
    - Verify that components work together correctly
    - More complex than unit tests but fewer in number

3. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Top)** 🏁
    - Simulate complete user flows through the application
    - Test the application as a whole
    - Fewest in number but most comprehensive

## Types of Tests and Tools 🛠️

### Unit Tests 🧪

- **Purpose:** Test individual functions, utilities, and small components
- **Tools:** Vitest, Jest
- **Location:** `__tests__/` or `.test.ts` files
- **Example:** Testing utility functions, hooks, or small components

### Component/Integration Tests 🧩

- **Purpose:** Test React components and their interactions
- **Tools:** React Testing Library
- **Location:** `__tests__/` or `.test.tsx` files
- **Example:** Testing component rendering, user interactions, and state changes

### API Route Tests (Integration) 🌐

- **Purpose:** Test Next.js API routes
- **Tools:** Vitest/Jest with fetch mocking
- **Location:** `__tests__/api/`
- **Example:** Testing API route handlers and responses

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests 🎭

- **Purpose:** Test complete user flows
- **Tools:** Playwright, Cypress
- **Location:** `e2e/`
- **Example:** Testing user registration, login, and checkout flows

## Where to Start 🚀

1. Test your components first
2. Add unit tests for utility functions
3. Test API routes
4. Add E2E tests for critical user flows

## Test Coverage 📊

Aim for meaningful test coverage rather than just hitting a percentage target. Focus on testing critical paths and edge cases.

## Running Tests ▶️

Refer to `package.json` scripts for running tests. Ensure all tests pass in your CI pipeline.
