# State Management Guidelines 🧠

Managing state effectively is crucial for building scalable and maintainable React applications. This guide outlines different approaches and provides guidance on when to use them within this boilerplate. 📋

## Levels of State 📊

Think about state in terms of its scope and lifecycle:

1.  **Local Component State:** 🏠

    - **What:** State managed entirely within a single component.
    - **Tools:** `useState`, `useReducer` ⚛️
    - **When to use:** For state that doesn't need to be shared with other components (e.g., form input values, toggle states within a specific component, UI interaction state like "is the dropdown open?"). 🎯
    - **Pros:** Simple, co-located with component logic. ✨
    - **Cons:** Not suitable for shared state. 🚫

2.  **Shared State (via Prop Drilling):** 🔄

    - **What:** State lifted up to a common ancestor component and passed down via props.
    - **Tools:** Standard React Props ⚛️
    - **When to use:** For simple sharing between a parent and a few direct or nearby descendants. 🎯
    - **Pros:** Explicit data flow. ✨
    - **Cons:** Can become cumbersome ("prop drilling") if state needs to pass through many intermediate components. 🚫

3.  **Context State:** 🌐

    - **What:** State shared across a component subtree without explicit prop drilling.
    - **Tools:** `React.createContext`, `useContext` ⚛️
    - **When to use:** For low-frequency updates of state needed by many components in a subtree (e.g., theme information, user authentication status, language preference). 🎯
    - **Pros:** Avoids prop drilling for deeply nested consumers. ✨
    - **Cons:** Can cause performance issues if the context value updates frequently, as all consuming components might re-render. Best for relatively stable data. 🚫

4.  **Global State Management Libraries:** 🌍

    - **What:** Dedicated libraries for managing application-level state accessible from anywhere.
    - **Tools:** Zustand, Jotai, Redux Toolkit 🛠️
    - **When to use:** For complex state needed in many unrelated parts of the application, or when fine-grained control over updates and performance is required. 🎯
    - **Pros:** Centralized state logic, powerful developer tools, often optimized for performance (e.g., selectors preventing unnecessary re-renders). ✨
    - **Cons:** Adds complexity and boilerplate compared to simpler methods. Choose a library that fits the project scale and team familiarity. 🚫

5.  **Server State Management Libraries:** 🌐
    - **What:** Libraries specifically designed for managing state related to data fetching, caching, synchronization, and updates with a server.
    - **Tools:** React Query (TanStack Query), SWR 🛠️
    - **When to use:** **Strongly recommended** for managing data fetched from APIs. Handles caching, background re-fetching, mutations (including optimistic updates), loading/error states, etc., significantly simplifying data fetching logic. 🎯
    - **Pros:** Reduces boilerplate for data fetching, improves performance through caching, enhances user experience with features like stale-while-revalidate. ✨
    - **Cons:** Another dependency to learn, but the benefits usually outweigh the cost for applications heavily interacting with APIs. 🚫

## Recommendations 💡

- **Start Local:** Keep state as local as possible initially. 🏠
- **Lift State:** Lift state only when necessary for sharing. 🔄
- **Use Context Sparingly:** Prefer Context for low-frequency, relatively stable global data like themes or authentication status. 🌐
- **Adopt Server State Libraries:** Use React Query or SWR for managing API data state. This often eliminates the need for complex global state solutions for server data. 🌍
- **Consider Global Libraries for Complex UI State:** If you have complex application-level UI state that is _not_ directly tied to server data, then libraries like Zustand or Jotai can be beneficial. 🎨

Choose the simplest approach that meets the requirements first, and scale up to more complex solutions only when needed. 🎯
